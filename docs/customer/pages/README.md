# Page-by-page guides

Each guide follows: Purpose → When to use it → How to get there → What you can do → Related pages.

Every route is also listed in the [complete page index](../PAGE_INDEX.md).

## Core

| Page | What it covers |
|------|----------------|

| [Create new guest VM](core/create.md) | Create a new libvirt VM. |
| [Node Devices](core/devices.md) | Node Devices — Machina Core page at `/devices`. |
| [Fleet](core/fleet.md) | Fleet — Machina Core page at `/fleet`. |
| [Dashboard](core/home.md) | Host dashboard — VM inventory pulse, Vessel container shortcuts when Podman/Docker is connected, and quick links. |
| [SSH — hypervisor](core/host-ssh.md) | Host SSH — Machina Core page at `/host-ssh`. |
| [Import guest VM](core/import.md) | Import VM — Machina Core page at `/import`. |
| [Systemd Services](core/services.md) | Services — Machina Core page at `/services`. |
| [Sprites](core/sprites.md) | Instant, disposable sandbox VMs — boot on libvirt/QEMU, Cloud Hypervisor, or Firecracker, TTL-reaped automatically, no persistent state. |
| [VM detail: Guest policy](core/vm-guest-policy.md) | Restrict what individual containers inside a VM may do: which networks they reach, which programs they run, which devices they open and where they write. The rules are enforced inside the guest by GuestKit's agent (`guestkitd`) with its own eBPF programs. Machina sends them through the QEMU guest agent, so no network path into the guest is needed. |
