## 1. What Machina is

Machina is an **enterprise Linux hypervisor management platform**. It is a
unified control plane for **VMs, networks, storage, snapshots, and day-two
operations** on bare-metal worker nodes, built directly on **libvirt / QEMU /
KVM**, with a native eBPF networking datapath (`machina-bpfd`) and a
self-service **Fleet Cloud** layer on the same controller. In the Zyvor stack it
owns the metal; Atlas (storage) and GuestKit (guest tooling) plug into it, and
its native eBPF stack replaces separate Cilium/Tetragon-style agents.

The problem it solves: libvirt operations are normally scattered across `virsh`
scripts, consoles need separate gateways, and there is no fleet observability.
Machina folds all of that into one daemon + one API + one UI:

| Problem | Machina answer |
|---------|----------------|
| libvirt ops scattered across `virsh` scripts | One dashboard + REST API for the full VM lifecycle |
| Consoles need separate gateways | Built-in noVNC, SPICE, serial and SSH proxies |
| No fleet observability | Prometheus, alerts, webhooks, PSI/cgroups, OTLP export |
| KubeVirt migration is manual | YAML bundles + documented migration paths |
| Vendor hypervisor lock-in | Open-source Rust daemon on your own metal |

## 2. Architecture & tech stack

Machina is a **two-layer platform**:

- **`machina-daemon`** — the single-host hypervisor manager and the original
  product. It owns the REST API at `/api/v1`, WebSocket streams at `/ws/v1`,
  console proxying (VNC/SPICE/serial/SSH), PAM/LDAP/OIDC auth with RBAC, and
  speaks directly to libvirt. Built with **Axum 0.8 / Tokio**. Serves on
  **:5092** (HTTPS by default).
- **`machina-controller`** — the optional multi-host enterprise control plane.
  It persists state in an embedded SQLite database (no external DB),
  distributes tasks over an in-memory or NATS bus, and runs the HA, DRS,
  reconcile and AI engines. Talks to hosts through `machina-agent` over gRPC/TLS.
  Serves on **:5093**.
- **`machina-agent`** — runs on each managed hypervisor, exposes a gRPC service
  (tonic), executes libvirt operations for the controller, and proxies console
  WebSockets. Listens on **:50051** (gRPC) and **:50052** (console).

### Workspace crates

| Crate | Binary | Role |
|-------|--------|------|
| `core` | — | Shared types: VM/host/config structs, libvirt helpers, XML builders, audit, fleet placement |
| `daemon` | `machina-daemon` | Single-host REST+WS API server, auth, console proxies |
| `controller` | `machina-controller` | Multi-host control plane: fleet, HA, DRS, AI engine, tasks |
| `agent` | `machina-agent` | Per-host gRPC agent executing libvirt ops |
| `spec` | — | Declarative VM/cluster spec types |
| `translate` | — | libvirt domain XML → internal type translation |
| `rvb` | — | Reverse-bridge helpers |
| `virt-image-build` | — | virt-builder / mkosi golden-image job runner |
| Packer / dockur scripts | `contrib/packer/` | Golden Forge: Linux Packer (`build-linux-image.sh`); Windows 10/11 via dockur/Podman (`build-windows-dockur.sh`, gated by `dockur_windows_allowed`) |
| `run-as-user-helper` | — | setuid helper for run-as-user impersonation |

### Web UI

React 19 + Vite 8 + TailwindCSS 4, with `@xterm/xterm` terminals, `novnc-core`
consoles, `recharts` charts, and `three` for 3D topology views. Design system is
**Liquid Glass** (macOS-Tahoe-inspired glass primitives in
`web/src/components/glass/`). In dev, Vite serves the UI on **:3000** and proxies
`/api` and `/ws` to `https://localhost:5092`.

## 3. Surfaces

Machina exposes three ways to drive it.

### 3.1 `machinactl` CLI

The install/manage/demo CLI at the repo root. It auto-escalates to root via
`sudo` and talks to the API at `${MACHINA_URL:-https://127.0.0.1:5092}`.

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `deps` | Install all system dependencies (libvirt, qemu-kvm, build tools, Rust, Node) |
| `build [--no-web]` | `cargo build --workspace --release` (+ web UI unless `--no-web`) |
| `test` | `cargo test --workspace` |
| `install` / `uninstall` | Install/remove Machina to/from the system (`make install`) |
| `deploy` | Full: deps → build → install → start → verify |
| `reinstall` | stop → build → install → start → verify |
| `upgrade` | `git pull --ff-only` then reinstall |
| `start` / `stop` / `restart` / `status` / `logs` | Manage the `machina-daemon` service |
| `backup now\|enable\|disable\|status\|logs` | VM backup + daily timer control |
| `verify` | Post-install smoke test (API, VMs, backup) |
| `health` | Deep health check (service, API, disk, libvirt, timers) — exit 0/1/2 |
| `doctor` | System readiness (KVM, systemd, required commands) |
| `tls` | Generate a self-signed TLS cert into `/etc/machina/ssl/` |
| `demo` | Interactive REST API demo |
| `audit verify [N]` | Verify the signed audit log (via API or local file) |
| `integrations` | Show KubeVirt/k8s/automation status |

There is also `scripts/platformctl` — a thin CLI over the **controller** REST API
(`${MACHINA_CONTROLLER_URL:-http://127.0.0.1:5093}`): `health`, `hosts`,
`host validate`, `vms`, `vm get/metrics/adopt`, `content`, `marketplace`,
`tasks`, `events-stream`.

### 3.2 REST API (`/api/v1`)

All REST routes are nested under `/api/v1`; WebSocket routes under `/ws/v1`.
Every `/api/v1` route passes through auth middleware (login/session routes
bypass internally). Highlights:

**VM lifecycle** (`routes/vms.rs`)

| Method & path | Action |
|---------------|--------|
| `GET /vms` · `POST /vms` · `POST /vms/stream` | List / create / create-with-progress |

(scrape), `GET /events/stream` (SSE), `GET /health` · `/health/problems`,
`GET /node`, `GET /openapi.json`.

**Host** (`host_network.rs`, `system.rs`): host interfaces, bridges, routing,
port-forward, firewall, `GET /system/platform-info`, OS-user management, and
runtime auth config (`/system/auth/ldap-settings`, `/oidc-settings`,
`/saml-settings`).

**Fleet** (`fleet.rs`): `GET /fleet/status\|metrics\|alerts\|vms`,
`POST /fleet/placement\|create-vm`, `GET /fleet/prometheus`.

**Integrations** (mounted under `/api/v1`): `vessel` (local Podman/Docker),
`k8s`, `kubevirt`, `fluxvm`, `guestkit`, `zeus_firewall`, `automation`,
`backup`, `jobs`, `templates`, `guest_images`, `platform_controller`
(reverse-proxy to the controller).

> The full machine-readable contract is served at `GET /api/v1/openapi.json`
> and mirrored in the UI at `/api-docs`.

### 3.3 WebSocket streams (`/ws/v1`)

Authenticated with a single-use token minted by `POST /api/v1/ws-token`, passed
as `?token=`:

| Path | Stream |
|------|--------|
| `/ws/v1/watch` | Event / state change stream |
| `/ws/v1/console/{name}` | Serial console |
| `/ws/v1/vnc/{name}` | VNC |
| `/ws/v1/spice/{name}` | SPICE |
| `/ws/v1/rdp/{name}` | RDP |
| `/ws/v1/terminal/{session_id}` | Terminal / PTY |
| `/ws/v1/ssh/{host}` | SSH |
| `/ws/v1/k8s-kubevirt/{ns}/{name}/vnc\|console` | KubeVirt VNC / console |
| `/ws/v1/vessel/containers/{id}/stats\|logs` | Container CPU/mem/network stats or log stream |
| `/ws/v1/platform/vnc\|serial\|spice/{vm_id}` | Platform-proxied consoles |

### 3.4 Web UI

Two shells share one daemon:

- **Classic (daemon-backed)** — `/`, `/vms`, `/create`, `/import`, `/fleet`,
  `/storage`, `/disk-images`, `/snapshots`, `/backups`, `/networks`,
  `/nwfilters`, `/host-networking`, `/secrets`, `/containers` (+ `/containers/pods`
  for Podman pods), `/k8s` (+ `/k8s/workloads`, `/k8s/kata`), `/host-ssh`,
  `/settings`, `/api-docs`, plus the Fleet Cloud
  pages under `/fleet-cloud/*`.
- **Platform (controller-backed)** — `/platform/*` with its own shell:
  Mission Control, Virtual Machines, Hosts, Applications, Launchpad, Datacenter
  View, Disk Utility, Storage Tiers, Networks, Content, Templates, Cloud-Init
  Studio, Migration Assistant, Blueprints, Zyra AI, Security Operations, Policy,
  Webhooks, Backup & Restore, Fleet Snapshots, Disaster Recovery, High
  Availability, Observability, Topology, GPU Command Center, Users & Groups,
  API Keys, Integrations, Marketplace, and more.

  **Hosts** (`/platform/hosts`) is the fleet cockpit: a summary strip (machines online, VMs,
  average CPU, memory, how many need attention), a **Needs attention** list that only names
  machines that need a person (offline, failed validation, stale heartbeat, fenced, not
  schedulable) with a **Re-check** button, and three views of the same machines: **Cloud map**
  (default with two or more machines), **Cards** and **List**. Selecting a machine opens a side
  panel with its address, agent address, versions, the validation checklist with the fix for each
  failing check, and the actions: sync, enter or exit maintenance (with a "move VMs off" choice),
  fence or unfence (asks first) and remove (asks you to type the host name). **Add machine**
  opens the join wizard. The transport badge (mutual TLS / token) and agent version appear only
  when the controller reports them.

The login page uses PAM (Linux host accounts) by default; LDAP and OIDC SSO can
be enabled. See [Admin & Configuration → Authentication](admin-configuration.md#5-authentication--rbac).

## 4. Feature deep-dives

### VM lifecycle

Full create → run → migrate → delete lifecycle via API, UI, or `machinactl`.
Creation supports two backends, selected by `[libvirt].create_backend`
(default `virt_install`) or per-request `create_backend`: `virt_install`
(wraps `virt-install`) or `libvirt_xml` (native domain XML). Golden images can be
built asynchronously via `POST /jobs/virt-image-build` (virt-builder / mkosi).
Hot-plug of disks and NICs, vCPU/RAM resize, CPU pinning, block-job (commit/pull)
online disk operations, and live migration (with bandwidth/downtime tuning) are
all first-class. The GuestKit QEMU guest agent can be injected into every new VM
(`[libvirt].guest_agent_by_default = true`) for cloud-init seeding and offline
inject.

### Storage

libvirt storage pools and volumes: list pools, start/stop/refresh, toggle
autostart, and create/delete volumes per pool. Disk images are surfaced in the
UI at `/disk-images`; per-VM disk resize and IO tuning are available.

### Networks

libvirt virtual networks (create/delete/start/stop, autostart, edit XML), plus
host-level networking: interfaces, bridges, routing tables, LLDP, sysctl tuning,
port-forwarding and firewall rules (`routes/host_network.rs`). Network filters
(nwfilter) are managed at `/nwfilters`. Autostart networks are bootstrapped at
daemon boot.

### VM network policy

VM-to-VM segmentation in the CiliumNetworkPolicy schema, enforced by
`machina-bpfd` on each VM tap (observe by default, enforce under a lease).
On top of L3/L4, DNS names and L7 rules: flow history with a service map,
learn mode and replay, L7 metrics, lateral-movement alerts, DNS threat feeds,
quarantine, just-in-time access, plain-English drafts with approval,
Fleet Cloud project isolation with egress allowlists and egress IPs, and
sealed segmentation evidence for audits. UI: VM Network Policies; CLI:
`machinactl [--fleet] netpol|flow`. Details:
[docs/ebpf/vm-network-policy.md](../ebpf/vm-network-policy.md).

### Snapshots & backup

Per-VM snapshots (create/list/revert/delete) plus a scheduled backup subsystem:
`scripts/backup.sh` driven by `machinactl backup` and the `machina-backup.timer`
systemd unit (daily 2 AM). Backups go to `[backup].backup_dir`
(`/var/lib/machina/backups`), optionally to an NFS target, with configurable
retention and optional disk inclusion.

### Consoles

Built-in console proxies remove the need for a separate gateway: **noVNC**
(`/novnc` static client + `/ws/v1/vnc/{name}`), **SPICE HTML5** (`/spice-html5`),
serial (`/ws/v1/console/{name}`), and **native_ssh** (in-browser PTY terminal).
Windows guests are auto-detected and get **native RDP** via a hypervisor NAT
port-forward to the guest's port 3389 — connect with Microsoft Remote Desktop
or `mstsc`, or download the generated `.rdp` file — advertised only once the
agent confirms Remote Desktop is listening in the guest. ConsoleHub brokers
sessions with TTLs and can be gated behind OIDC.

### Fleet, HA & the platform layer

The classic daemon has a lightweight peer-based fleet view
(`[fleet]` config → `/fleet/*` API). For full multi-host operation the
**controller** adds HA failover, DRS (distributed resource scheduling),
desired-state reconciliation, a task bus (in-memory or NATS), and the AI
engine behind Zyra AI. See [../controller-ha.md](../controller-ha.md),
[../daemon-peer-fleet.md](../daemon-peer-fleet.md) and the
[operator runbook](runbook.md).

### Integrations

- **Vessel** — local Podman or Docker on the hypervisor host. List/create
  containers, Podman pod CRUD, lifecycle, and WebSocket stats/logs via
  `/api/v1/vessel/*`. Enabled by default (`[vessel]`); fails soft when no
  engine socket is present. Kubernetes pods remain on `/k8s/workloads`.
- **KubeVirt** — export a VM as a KubeVirt YAML bundle
  (`GET /vms/{name}/kubevirt-bundle`) and apply/upload/start it on a cluster.
  See [../kubevirt-migration.md](../kubevirt-migration.md).
- **Fleet Cloud** (`/fleet-cloud/*` in the UI) — manage instances, flavors,
  networks, images, security groups, stacks, keypairs, and load balancers
  (kernel-level weighted round-robin, not an Octavia amphora) entirely via
  Machina's own native controller APIs — no external cloud connection, no
  credentials to wire up. The legacy external-cloud client integration
  (compute/image/network/identity management, and pushing local VMs to an
  external cloud) has been fully removed.
- **hyper2kvm / GuestKit** — VM migration into KVM and offline assurance.
- **Observability** — Prometheus scrape, remote-write ingest, OTLP/HTTP export
  to Grafana Alloy / OpenTelemetry Collector, Linux audit integration. See
  [../guides/observability.md](../guides/observability.md).
