"""Guard the controller's SQL migrations.

sqlx applies migrations by their numeric prefix, so two files with one number (it has happened: two branches each took the
next free number) or a renumbered, already-applied file breaks upgrades. Checks that every file is `NNN_name.sql`, that numbers
are unique and strictly increasing, and that no number is skipped except the documented historical gap. With `--base REF` it
also refuses to change or delete a migration that already exists at REF (applied migrations are immutable).

The PostgreSQL schema (controller/migrations_pg) must stay in step: its baseline file 000_postgres_schema.sql says which SQLite
migrations it covers ("000-060"); every SQLite migration after that needs a file with the same number in migrations_pg, and a
migrations_pg file may not exist for a number the baseline already covers. (The baseline itself may still change until the first
release that ships it; numbered files after it are immutable like the SQLite ones.)

Usage: scripts/ci/check-migrations.py [--base origin/main]
